# Middleware 

# Jargon Lingo

Separation of Concerns.
- we do NOT write code for the computer, code is a communication device, 
    a way to reveal our intentions to the next developer
- optimize for readability 

** Everythng is Middleware

## Types (based on how we got it or who built it)

- built-in: includes with express ex: `express.json()`
- third party: must be installed from `npm` 
- custom: we code this!

## Types (based on how  it's used)

- global: runs on every request
- 


Order matters, it goes top to bottom, and left to right
